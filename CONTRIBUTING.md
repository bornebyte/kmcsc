# Contributing to KMC Students Committee Website

First off, thank you for considering contributing! It's people like you that make open source such a great community.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue. Please include a clear title and description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate our efforts and prevent duplication of work.

### Pull Requests

We love pull requests! Here's a quick guide:

1.  **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure the test suite passes.
4.  Make sure your code lints.
5.  Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the `README.md` with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3.  Increase the version numbers in any examples and the `package.json` to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is SemVer.
4.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of another developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
